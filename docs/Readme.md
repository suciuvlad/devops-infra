Manually Register the Nomad Server with Your Service Discovery System:

This procedure varies depending on the service discovery system you are using. Generally, you would use an API or a configuration file to register a new service. Here's how you might do it with Consul, which is often used with Nomad and Traefik:

Let's say your Nomad server (with the UI enabled) is running on localhost:4646. You could register it with Consul like this:

consul services register nomad-ui.json

```{
  "Service": {
    "Name": "nomad-ui",
    "Tags": [
      "traefik.enable=true",
      "traefik.http.routers.nomad-ui.rule=Host(`nomad.purposeinplay.com`)"
    ],
    "Port": 4646,
    "Address": "localhost"
  }
}
```

Now that you have registered the nomad-ui service with Consul, the next step is to ensure that Traefik is configured to use Consul as a provider.

providers:
  consulCatalog:
    prefix: "traefik"
    exposedByDefault: false
    endpoint:
      address: "http://127.0.0.1:8500"  # change to your Consul server address if it's not on localhost
